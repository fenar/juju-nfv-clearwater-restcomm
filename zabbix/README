# Creating a Zabbix.

You do need a machine external to Juju to show the true integration.

You must open the following port 80 (interface), 10050 et 10051 (zabbix)

Create a security group if on AWS or OpenStack to ensure you can connect to and be sure you can access that machine/vm.

Then simply do:
./install-on-machine 54.164.161.172

Use your IP of course.

If blocked with a "Cleaning" msg .. kill and restart (it should be idempotent)

Then http://54.164.161.172/zabbix/ 
login admin / ubuntu

# connect your JUJU env and agents.
